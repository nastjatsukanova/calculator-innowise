How to run the app:
1) Write "npm i" to install dependencies;
2) Write "npm start" in terminal;
3) "Ctrl + Click" on the link in the terminal ;

Main functions: 
1) MS - memory save, value in the input will be saved in local Storage;

2) MR - memory read, value from local storage will be added in input;

3) MC - memory clean, local storage will be cleared;

4) M+ - memory plus, value from local storage will be added to input value;

5) M- - memory minus, value from input will be subtracted from the value in local storage;

6) x in power of y (in calculator it depicted as a root sign of the fourth degree) - you whould write the value in input then click this button, click number (value of power) - in input it will be your initial value in power of second number; Power can be from 0 to 9;

7) 10 in power of x - you should write the number, click this button and in input it will 10 in power of your inout value; Power can be from 0 to 9;

8) the root of degree y of x - you whould write the value in input then click this button, click number (value of root) - in input it will be your root degree the second number of initial value; Root can be from 0 to 9;


Test:
1) Write "npm test" to start testing.
2) See the results of testing functions (root of 2, root of 3, power of 2, power of 3, change sign, ten in power, factorial)
